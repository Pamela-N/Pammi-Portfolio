<h1>My Journey at ADA</h1>

            <h2>How I Was Selected</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Where do I even begin??
                <br> 
                The journey began when a friend introduced me to Harambee, I registered online and was called for assessments, these consisted of language and problem solving questions, and luckily for me, those are my strong points. After writing tests about three times I was invited to ADA for an Interview.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Soon afterwards, on a cold Saturday, my life was changed forever and  I was given a new purpose. It was the ADA games day, testing potential students for an aptitude and ability in creative thinking and group work. As cold and tired as I was, I gave it my best in creating a game and presenting it. Our team won that challenge and I was invited to come for the bootcamp.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The days got colder and it became even harder to wake up, but I could not let this opportunity pass me by so I attended the bootcamp. Within the 3 days of the bootcamp I was introduced to the world of coding and fell in love with it, during this time I even received a job offer that I had been waiting for, there I was not knowing whether to start a new job or cling onto the chance to learn codingâ€¦ and as the universe would have it coding chose me.</p>

            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I aced the first Semester, quickly grasping the Html and Css concepts, I was able to create a basic website and came out top of the class. The second semester I hit my first hump as I went through so much on a personal level that it hindered my progress but with the help of my lecturers and classmates I pushed through.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As we were enjoying and learning new development skills in the third semester, Covid-19 hit and we had to stay home and stay safe. We had work to try and keep ourselves busy, but not being in the environment we had become accustomed to, it was HARD!</p>
            <br>
            <p>We were excited to return to class and continue learning, as we got back into the swing of things everything we had learned came flooding back. It was sad to learn how we could no longer do internships because of Covid-19, However, we can always move forward with the skills that we have learnt in the last 7 months.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On this journey I have discovered new personality traits about myself, some good, some not so good ,there were times that I wanted to give up because I began questioning myself and if it was all worth it, friendships were formed and I am truly honored to have experienced it with the group I was with.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It has been a year full of humps and bumps but I MADE IT!</p>
